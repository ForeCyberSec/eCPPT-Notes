# Mapping the internal network 

In the previous step, we took into account information residing on the local 
victim computer. We will now take a look at the network 


As the name suggests, the main purpose of this step is to map the internal 
organizations network in order to find other exploitable machines to get closer 
to our goal (if any in the specified engagement) 

Since we already have access to at least one internal machine, we can directly 
interact with the target environment (internal network) using it as a bridge

Again, the purpose of this step is to infiltrate and exploit more hosts

this is important when we have to prove that certain areas of the network are 
vulnerable or, when the client wants to verify the exposure of certain
information stored on given devices
