# FTP Bounce Scan info


The -b (FTP Bounce Scan) is another stealthy scan option we can use. Also known as an FTP Bounce Attack,
this type of scan exploits an FTP servers' "PORT" command and if an FTP server is vulnerable, allows 
us to launhc port scans from the FTP server to other machines on the internet, or even to conduct
scans against machines we dont have direct access to on an internal network


All scans using this method will appear to have originated from the FTP server and will hide our true source
