# Enumerating NFS


Please note that since NFS is an RPC-based service and relies on other RPC services, such as 
"mountd", it should be directly queried via the Portmapper service which is found on port TCP
and/or UDP 111 when using nmap NSE scripts for instance 

We'll cover Portmapper services shortly

An administrator wishing to share files from an NFS server will configure what are known as 
"exports". Exports are the mechanism used by NFS in order to "export" directories, in other 
words, make entire directories available to other users over the network 

Exports configured for any given NFS server can usually be found in the "etc/exports" file on a
target host locally. For now, we're going to focus on identifying available exports from a remote 
perspective 

One common issue with NFS, is that administrators will usually "export" directories with little
attention to security, and will usually export directories in a manner that allows any host 
or IP to connect, without any authentication, and if we're lucky, also provide write-access to
directories

Once we've identified that a server is running NFS, the first thing we want to do is query it 
with several nmap NSE scripts. Specifically, "nfs-ls", "nfs-showmount" and "nfs-statfs"

We can find some NSE scripts we can use for NFS with a simple command: 

## ls usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep nfs



We can then use a command similar to the following to obtain results relevant to NFS: 

## nmap --script nfs-ls,nfs-showmount,nfs-statfs <targetIP>


Example return output from the above command shown in folder
