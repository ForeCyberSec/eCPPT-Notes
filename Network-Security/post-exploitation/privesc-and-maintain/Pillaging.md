# Pillaging 

Once we have built our way into the victim machine, we can move on to the next phase: Data Harvesting
aka pillaging 

pillaging is the step in which you access sensitive data and intellectual property of the target 
organization 

Demonstrating the feasability of an external hacker accessing this information might be the goal of
the overall engagement, so this phase is critical

However, according to the type of machine you have compromised, you may
or may not find what you are looking for. This presents the need to
further exploit and infiltrate the network

Therefore in this step we will also harvest data and information
necessary for this purpose
