# Linux Privilege Escalation 


Although Metasploit offers some privilege escalation modules for Linux OS's, the best way
to proceed is by getting information about the current OS and then searching for publicly 
available exploits

Notice that privilege escalation exploits are very OS specific, so information about the OS
and the applications installed on the machine may result in very useful information to
narrow down your search
